# Quantum Machine Learning: Variational classifier

This is a [Xanadu tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier.html) for PennyLane's library wich has the purpose to implement a variational quantum classifier. Here I will train a quantum circuit with labelled data and then use it to classify new data following the mentioned tutorial.

This tutorial is made up of 2 parts

- [x] Fitting the parity function
    For this I will have to:
    - [x] Create the quantum device and build up the circuit.
    - [x] Define the Cost function. 
    - [x] Optimice the classifier with the training data.
    - [x] Then run and test the classifier.

- [x] Iris Classification
    - [x] Create the quantum device and build up the circuit.
    - [x] Load the Iris data set. 
    - [x] Optimice the classifier with the training data.
    - [x] Then run and test the classifier.
