# Quantum Machine Learning: Variational classifier

This is a [Xanadu tutorial](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier.html) for PennyLane's library wich has the purpose to implement a variational quantum classifier. Here I will train a quantum circuit with labelled data and then use it to classify new data following the mentioned tutorial.
